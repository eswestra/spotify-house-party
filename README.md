# spotify-house-party

**This project is still a work in progress**

Small Repo in which I aim to build spotify connect / listen together type application in Django and React.

This application somewhat follows the structure of an online tutorial by TechWithTim, however, this tutorial uses class based components and slightly older django api logic.

In this repository I aim to improve on the tutorial project using React Hooks, proper API logic, dynamic api routers, and any other best practices and improvements I can think of.

The aim of this project merely educational and should not be run in production.
